My solutions to the problems in [Rosalind's Python Village](http://rosalind.info)


## Python Village

This track is mainly to get you comfortable using the rosalind platform. For each problem you code the
solution, and then download the dataset from the [website](http://rosalind.info). Run your program with
this dataset as the input, and upload the output on the website.
