My solutions to the problems in [Rosalind's Python Village](http://rosalind.info)


## Python Village

This track is mainly to get you comfortable using the rosalind platform. For each problem you code the
solution, and then download the dataset from the [website](http://rosalind.info). Run your program with
this dataset as the input, and upload the output on the website.

- [Installing Python](http://rosalind.info/problems/ini1/)
- [Variables and some Arithmetic](http://rosalind.info/problems/ini2/)
- [Strings and Lists](http://rosalind.info/problems/ini3/)
- [Conditionals and Loops](http://rosalind.info/problems/ini4/)
- [Working with Files](http://rosalind.info/problems/ini5/) For this problem, open your output file and copy the contents. Paste that into the answer box on the rosalind website.
- [Dictionaries](http://rosalind.info/problems/ini6/)


## Algorithmic Heights
This track has classic algorithm problems.
- [rosalind_in.txt] This file is where I put the sample inputs.
- [rosalind_out.txt] The program writes the output to this file. 
- [Majority Element](http://rosalind.info/problems/list-view/?location=algorithmic-heights) The question asks which element occurs more than half the number of times in the array. After sorting, check the count of middle element. If it is more than half, that is the answer, else -1.
- [Degree Array](http://rosalind.info/problems/deg/) Just make a linear scan through the input and increase the count of every vertex you find.
